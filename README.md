## About the website

**Primark** is a renowned international retailer that offers the latest fashion, beauty, and homeware at the best value on the high street. The history of the company dates back to 1969 when the very first store was launched in Dublin, Ireland, under the name Penneys. However, due to the presence of another brand with a similar name in Europe, the company decided to rebrand all of its European stores as Primark in 1973. The brand is owned by Associated British Foods and is not a public company; hence, theres no stock market symbol, IPO date or market cap at IPO.
